# MiSTer Unstable and Test Core Updater Scripts
These scripts are useful for quickly getting the nightly core and MiSTer main binary files.

## Instructions
1) Place update_unstable.ini in main folder of sd card
2) Place update_unstable.sh in Scripts folder of the sd card
3) Place update_unstable_main.sh in Scripts folder of the sd card

Note: unstable cores and unstable main binary are for bleeding edge testing and should not be used as the basis for bug reports  unless the core author is aware you're using nightly builds.

## Disclaimer
Use these scripts at your own risk. Back up your important files before running.
